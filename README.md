Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a scientist and engineer working in the field of genomics. 

I'm very fortunate to work with a wonderful community of scientists from around the world to study the mosquitoes that transmit malaria. Together we are [building shared genomic datasets](https://www.malariagen.net/malaria-vector-genome-observatory/) and using them to monitor mosquito populations and learn about how they are evolving in response to malaria control interventions.

I also love code and the transformative power of open source software to empower scientists and build bridges between people and data. I've contributed to various open source software projects and am a big fan of the Python scientific computing ecosystem and community.

If you're into using big data, code and computing technology to level the playing field for folks tackling the hard problems in improving human health, please reach out, I'd love to meet you!
